/* Country-borders and states/provinces overlay.
 *
 * Vector data is NOT baked into the binary -- it's fetched once from the
 * OHB backend (same download+inflate mechanism as the file-style core maps)
 * and cached locally, then reused across restarts. Unlike Clouds/Terrain/etc
 * this data never expires (borders don't change), so there's no age check --
 * once cached, it's used indefinitely.
 *
 * Both country borders and states/provinces share one on-disk format (magic
 * "HCBD": ring count, then per-ring point count + int16 centidegree lon/lat
 * pairs) and one in-memory representation (BorderSet), so loading/fetching/
 * reprojecting/drawing is written once and used for both datasets.
 *
 * Screen-coordinate projection is cached per set and only recomputed when
 * pan/zoom/projection/map geometry actually changes (checked cheaply on
 * every call), since re-projecting tens of thousands of points on every
 * map redraw would be wasteful, especially on constrained builds. States
 * are also only meaningful at HamClock's closest zoom level -- world view
 * with every state/province outline for the whole planet is just noise --
 * so they're skipped entirely (no reprojection, no draw) at any other zoom.
 *
 * Drawing follows the same pattern as satellite ground tracks in
 * earthsat.cpp: walk consecutive vertex pairs, skip (don't draw) any
 * segment segmentSpanOkRaw() says shouldn't be connected (off map, wraps
 * around an edge, crosses an azimuthal hemisphere, etc) rather than trying
 * to clip/split polygons the way the filled CQ/ITU zones do -- borders are
 * outlines only, so a skipped segment is invisible, not wrong-looking.
