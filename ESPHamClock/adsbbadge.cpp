/* adsbbadge.cpp -- on-map "ADS-B" badge for HamClock
 *
 * Unlike the Borders/Fires badges this has no on/off state of its own and draws nothing onto the
 * map itself -- it's just a link button, same idea as the WEFAX/Wind badges (which launch/link
 * out instead of toggling an overlay). Tapping it opens ADS-B Exchange's live globe map, centered
 * on DE, via openURLPopupEmbed() -- see qrz.cpp.
 *
 * On-map presence, not buried in the map menu: shown on every core map type (Countries, Terrain,
 * DRAP, MUF-VOACAP, MUF-RT, Aurora, Weather, TOA, REL, Clouds, Tropo, User), in any projection.
 * Borders/Fires restrict themselves to the Mercator/Robinson projections because they toggle a
 * map overlay that only renders sensibly in those -- that restriction doesn't apply here, since
 * this badge doesn't draw anything on the map itself, just floats along the always-present View
 * button's row (which exists regardless of projection) and opens a link when tapped.
