# HamClock for Android

HamClock is available for Android and Amazon Fire OS devices.

## Installation

* **Google Play Store**: Install directly from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.openhamclock.hamclock) for Android phones, tablets, and Android TV / Google TV.
* **Amazon Appstore**: Install via the Amazon Appstore for Amazon Fire tablets and Fire TV devices.
* **Direct APK Download**: Standalone release APKs (`org.openhamclock.hamclock-<version>.apk`) are available on the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/openhamclock/hamclock/releases) page for direct installation and sideloading.

### Supported Devices
* Minimum supported OS: **Android 5.0+ (API 21+)**, including Amazon Fire OS tablets & Fire TV Sticks.

## Architecture

* **Core Engine:** The native C++ HamClock engine is compiled via Android NDK using `-D_WEB_ONLY` and `-D_CLOCK_1600x960` (crisp 2x resolution for 1080p and 2K screens).
* **Display & Touch:** Interactive HTML5/WebSocket frontend rendered inside an accelerated, fullscreen Android `WebView`.
* **Zero Source Duplication:** The NDK CMake build references `../../../../ESPHamClock` directly.

## Building from Source

### Option 1: Android Studio (Recommended)
1. Open **Android Studio**.
2. Select **Open** and choose the `android/` directory (`/path/to/hamclock/android`).
3. Allow Gradle to sync and download NDK/SDK dependencies if prompted.
4. Select **Build > Build Bundle(s) / APK(s) > Build APK(s)** or click **Run** on a connected device/emulator.

### Option 2: Command Line (with Android SDK installed)

#### Build Debug APK:
```bash
cd android
./gradlew assembleDebug
```
The resulting APK will be located at:
`android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/org.openhamclock.hamclock-<version>-debug.apk`

#### Build & Sign Release App Bundle (.aab) for Google Play:
Set the keystore file and key alias in your environment (passwords will be prompted interactively and securely):
```bash
cd android
ANDROID_KEYSTORE_FILE=~/.keystores/hamclock-upload-key.p12 ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS=hamclock ./gradlew bundleRelease
```
*(You will be prompted to enter the keystore and key passwords without echoing them to the terminal).*

The resulting signed release bundle will be located at:
`android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/org.openhamclock.hamclock-<version>-release.aab`
*(also available as `app-release.aab`)*

## Build Requirements (for compiling from source)
